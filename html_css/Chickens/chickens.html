<h1>Chicken</h1>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">Go to wikipedia site</a>

<p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red
    junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
    others
    are kept as pets or for cockfighting.Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of
    23.7 billion as of 2018, and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce
    over
    300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered, and the wings are
    short.[17] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a
    short distance.[18] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[17] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy
    crest
    on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called
    wattles;
    combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the
    face,
    giving the appearance of a beard.</p>
<h2>Reproduction and life-cycle</h2>
<p>To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering the
    wing which is closest to the hen.[31] The dance triggers a response in the hen[31] and when she responds to his
    call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the
    male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise,
    she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a
    tail-bending display.[32]</p>
<h2>Origin and dispersal</h2>
<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens
    belong to, survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their dinosaur
    relatives.[40] Chickens are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically
    classified as the same species.[41] Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[41]
    The domestic chicken has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green
    junglefowl;[42] a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds from the grey junglefowl
    (G. sonneratii).[43] It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of their genome with red junglefowl.[42]
</p>
<h3>Domestication</h3>
<p>According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise to
    the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[44] The red junglefowl is well adapted to
    take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle, to
    boost its own reproduction.[45] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of the red junglefowl's ability
    to reproduce prolifically when exposed to a surge in its food supply.[46]</p>
